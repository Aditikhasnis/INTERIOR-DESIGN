In the MERN stack, MongoDB and Express.js are used for the backend, while React.js is used for the front end, and Node.js serves as the runtime environment. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, facilitating schema-based data modeling and validation. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a middleware allowing controlled access to resources on a server from different origins. Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected, improving development efficiency
